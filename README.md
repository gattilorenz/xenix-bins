# xenix-bins
Various useful binaries (and sources + readme in some cases) for Xenix 386 2.3 (tested only on 2.3.4) and [SCO ODT 3.0 (SCO Unix 4.2)](SCO%20ODT%203.0/Readme.md).

The recovery bootable disk is a bootable floppy with many utilities to recover a broken system to a working state, or to modify the content of a hard drive before the 2nd part of the installation is completed. Since it stores stuff in a compressed bz2 file and uses a ramdrive to expand it (the Win98 bootdisk approach!), it requires a decent amount of RAM and might take quite a while to boot on older machines.
